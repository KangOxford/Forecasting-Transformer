# Time-Series-Forecasting
Trading Target(Volume/Volatility) Time Series Prediction in LOB

Forecasted Trading Volume is crucial in the VWAP replicating strategies and could be used in the [Optimal Execution](https://github.com/KangOxford/AlphaTrade), such as [Optimal Scheduling with Predicted Trading Volume](https://alphatrade.readthedocs.io/en/latest/future_research.html#future-research-topics). We have the [environment: AlphaTrade](https://github.com/KangOxford/AlphaTrade) built in Jax which can automatically paralleling the env and train/testing our algorithm on thousands of stocks at the same time, with a speed up over 100 times.

* Target: percentage change of volume
* Imbalance:<br>
  $\frac{x_{bid} - x_{ask}}{x_{bid}+x_{ask}}$
* Lookback window
  * disjoint lookback window
  * overlap lookback window
